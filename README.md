Hello world! I am learning github actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool built into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows such as building, testing, and deploying your code. Workflows are defined in YAML files inside the .github/workflows/ directory. You can trigger them on events like push, pull_request, or on a schedule.
